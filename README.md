# mtFociCounter

Welcome, this is the repository to contain the original branch of the mtFociCounter.
In this repository you will find:

A) several scripts which can be run and convert data.
B) several text-files on different topics.

In this read-me, we will first list all the files with a short explanation on what they are and contain:

A) There are currently three programms available:
i) a jupyter notebook (file-ending ipynb): 20211208_CytbKO_foci.ipynb
  This is an old version of a jupyter notebook which could serve as a template to analyse the data output by the Fiji-plugin "Foci Counter"
  Do not worry too much about it, it will be replaced in the future with something more robust and simpler to use - hopefully as a python-based web-application
ii) a jython-file called: FociCounter_b3_.ijm
  This is an older beta-version of the macro. in principle it does something, but it is not very polished and will eventually be replaced.
iii) a jython-file called: FociCounter_b7_.ijm
  This is the current beta-version, ready for testing. Please have a go and report anything that you are not happy with via e-mail to me!
  NOTE: not all functionalities are fully implemented, and the file should be updated in the future.

B) There are currently two description files available, a third one is in the making:
i) This README.md
  This mainly servers as a center for orientation and should be updated every now and then.
ii) A UserGuide
  This gives a basic explanation of how to use the mtFociCounter.
  It contains a step-by-step guide to how to install and run the plugin, and explains briefly what choices are available and what they are good for.
iii) Code-logic
  This does not yet exist, but should later allow to understand the logic of the script, what algorithms are used, and how the different sections work.
  
iv) Future directions:
  This does not yet exist but will contain my planned updates and ideas for future features.
  You are welcome to add your own branches with ideas!
v) Developer instructions:
  This does not exist yet, but I hope to eventually write this file to help guide potential efforts to improve the code to where I believe they would be best invested.
