# mtFociCounter
## Welcome to the README!

Welcome, this is the repository to contain the original branch of the mtFociCounter.  
In this repository you will find:  
**A) several scripts** which can be run and convert data.  
**B) several text-files** on different topics.  

In this read-me, we will first list all the files with a short explanation on what they are and contain:

### A) There are currently three programms available:

**i) a jupyter notebook (file-ending ipynb):** 20211208_CytbKO_foci.ipynb  
  This is an old version of a jupyter notebook which could serve as a template to analyse the data output by the Fiji-plugin "Foci Counter"  
  Do not worry too much about it, it will be replaced in the future with something more robust and simpler to use - hopefully as a python-based web-application

**ii) a jython-file called:** FociCounter_b10_.ijm  
  This is the current version with minor upgrades from the previous beta versions for better usability.
  Please have a go and report anything that you are not happy with via e-mail to me! [firstname + lastname, as indicated within the script, at hotmail.com]
  NOTE: further updates may be added in the future.

### B) There are currently two description files available, a third one is in the making:

**i) This README.md**  
  This mainly servers as a center for orientation and should be updated every now and then.

**ii) A UserGuide.md**  
  This gives a basic explanation of how to use the mtFociCounter.  
  It contains a step-by-step guide to how to install and run the plugin, and explains briefly what choices are available and what they are good for.

*iii) Code-logic* 
  This does not yet exist, but should later allow to understand the logic of the script, what algorithms are used, and how the different sections work.
  
*iv) Future directions:*  
  This does not yet exist but will contain my planned updates and ideas for future features.  
  You are welcome to add your own branches with ideas!

*v) Developer instructions:*  
  This does not exist yet, but I hope to eventually write this file to help guide potential efforts to improve the code to where I believe they would be best invested.
